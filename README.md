Handmade, naive, multiplayer simple card game attempt

This is MAUMAU card game,

this will be for free
no promises & guarantees about maintenance or release

goal of this "project" is to have some real software communicating with servers..

I will try to use this codebase during semester to implement distributed networking on server side of this game.

Also i might deploy this game wiht GUI on multiple platforms, just to finish & release something multiplatfrom tiny first.

This game is not original, nor i expect it to explode into BEST GAME EVA.
